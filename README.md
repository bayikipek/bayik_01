Assignment 01

First I set up the HTML file. From previous experience I knew how to use the <nav>, <ul>, <li>, and , <a href = "link"> tags. I looked up what the "#" was for in the <a href> tag. https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_a_href.asp 
Afterwards I searched how to make the class for the current page look.
https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_topnav.asp and created the "current" class in the css file and gave it a different name than the nav bar.

For CSS, I looked up how the vertical navigation bar works:

This website taught me a lot of details regarding the look of the nav bar.

Than I searched how to change the nav bar to horizontal when px become larger than 769. I found how to do it in the "responsive nav bar" section. https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar_horizontal.asp
